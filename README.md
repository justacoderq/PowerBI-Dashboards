# Power BI Dashboards Repository

Welcome to my Power BI Dashboards Repository! This repository contains a collection of Power BI projects, each with their own set of reports, visualizations, and data sources. These dashboards can be used for a variety of purposes, including business intelligence analysis, data exploration, and performance monitoring.

## Dashboard Projects

This repository contains the following dashboard project:

- HR Analytics Dashboard: A dashboard that displays HR data for a company, including Attrition count of Employees, Job Satisfaction rate, and Job Roles.
- Financial Report Dashboard: A dashboard that displays a summary on profits of a company. 

Each project folder contains a README.md file that describes the purpose of the dashboard, the data sources used, and any other relevant information. You can also find screenshots of the dashboard.
